# UniMiga

## Info

UniMiga is a WIP to make an VR Amiga emulator simulator.

- This project is VERY Work in progress at the moment! \*

### Background info

UniMiga started because I saw a Commodore 64 emulator VR room... But no Amiga VR room?!?!?
So... I'll do that... because Amiga was one of the greatest gaming computers in 80's and 90´s.

## Usage

You´ll need the SK.Libretro lib + Unity Libretro. Also install the Amiga core and get amiga kickstart roms.
